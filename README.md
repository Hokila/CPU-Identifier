# CPU-Identifier

This app can detect the chipset of your iPhone. For iPhone 6s / 6s Plus, it can detect the manufactory (TSMC or Samsung) of the A9 chip.

It would upload the chip model and device type info to my server, but it's for statistics only. I'll share the result of statistics later and I can't identify you from these information.

## How to Use
Open http://demo.hiraku.tw/CPUIdentifier on your iPhone 6s/6s Plus
